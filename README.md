The HiKorea website (http://hikorea.go.kr) is a an immigration website for foreigners in Korea. 

The main tasks that users can perform through the website are appointment reservation and e-applications. 
Through evaluating user experiences of the website, we found many issues in the interface. 
With the user centered design process, which includes project proposal, task analysis, low fidelity prototype, video prototype, heuristic evaluation and high fidelity prototype, we propose a mobile application to improve the user workflow with HiKorea.
